## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Webhook reliability** — `webhookQueue` worker backed by pg-boss with a
  6-attempt exponential backoff (30s → 2m → 10m → 30m → 2h → 6h) and a
  dead-letter table (`webhook_dlq`) for permanent failures. Replaces the
  old fire-and-forget `fetch` with a durable retry / DLQ pipeline.
- **Webhook signing** — `webhookSign` helper implementing GitHub-style
  `t=…,v1=…` HMAC-SHA256 with a 5-minute replay window and constant-time
  comparison. Idempotency enforced by `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE
  RETURNING id, (xmax=0) AS inserted` on `webhook_deliveries`.
- **Webhook Prometheus metrics** — `webhook_deliveries_total`,
  `webhook_delivery_attempts_total`, `webhook_delivery_duration_seconds`,
  plus `ai_summary_tokens_total`, `ai_summary_cost_usd_total`,
  `ai_summary_latency_seconds`, and `ai_summary_outcomes_total`.
- New database tables: `webhook_deliveries`, `webhook_dlq`,
  `prompt_versions`, and `ai_summary_calls`.
- **Soroban trust model** — 48h upgrade timelock
  (`propose_upgrade` / `execute_upgrade` / `cancel`), contract-level pause
  (`pause_contract` / `unpause_contract`), and two-step admin transfer
  (`transfer_admin` / `accept_admin` / `cancel`). Full threat model
  documented in `contracts/indigopay-contract/SECURITY.md` and
  `UPGRADE.md`.
- Backend observability env vars documented in `.env.example`
  (`METRICS_BEARER_TOKEN`, `INDEXER_*`, `SENTRY_*`, etc.).
- 32 Jest cases covering metrics, lifecycle, requestId, health, and
  readiness in `backend/__tests__/`.

### Changed

- `backend/src/routes/webhook.js` defers delivery to `webhookQueue`;
  the public route surface is preserved so existing partners keep working.
- `backend/src/server.js` wires `webhookQueue.start` into boot and
  registers a lifecycle shutdown hook to drain in-flight jobs on SIGTERM.
- Soroban contracts: extracted a shared `require_admin` helper and
  unified the admin panic message across all admin-only entry points.
- `docs/README.md` indexes every document by audience (users, developers,
  operators, contributors).

### Fixed

- `webhook.js` retry scheduler now uses `boss.send(..., { startAfter })`
  instead of relying on the implicit loop. A deduped enqueue returns the
  existing `deliveryId` rather than silently re-creating a row.
- `backend/src/services/indexerService` exposes a `stop()` method so the
  Stellar Horizon stream is closed cleanly on SIGTERM.
